# Safety Net Blueprint

> **Status: Work in progress** — The system is being designed incrementally, domain by domain, and proven through [steel thread prototypes](./docs/architecture/roadmap.md).

A systems integration blueprint for safety net benefits programs. Contract artifacts — OpenAPI specs, state machines, decision rules, metrics, and field metadata — define the full API surface for backend development. States adopt the blueprint, customize it with overlays, and build adapters to their vendor systems. Frontends develop against a mock server without waiting for a production backend.

> **Frontend harness packages** (form engine, safety harness, harness designer) live in a separate repository: [codeforamerica/safety-net-harness](https://github.com/codeforamerica/safety-net-harness).

## About This Repository

This repository contains the base contract artifacts, tooling, and documentation for the [contract-driven architecture](./docs/architecture/contract-driven-architecture.md). It provides:

- **Base contract artifacts** — OpenAPI specs, state machine definitions, decision rules, metrics, and field metadata that define both data operations (REST) and behavioral operations (RPC)
- **Conversion scripts** — generate contract YAML from tables (spreadsheets) so business users can author requirements directly
- **Validation** — check OpenAPI specs and cross-artifact consistency
- **Mock server** — interprets contracts with an in-memory database for development without a production backend, serving REST APIs, RPC APIs, and event streams
- **Field metadata** — annotations (program relevance, verification requirements, regulatory citations), field-level permissions, and multilingual labels as contract artifacts served by the backend
- **Client generation** — typed TypeScript SDK and Zod schemas from resolved specs
- **State overlays** — states customize contracts without forking the base files

States create their own repositories, install the base packages (`@codeforamerica/safety-net-blueprint-contracts`, `@codeforamerica/safety-net-blueprint-mock-server`, `@codeforamerica/safety-net-blueprint-clients`), and apply overlays. See the [State Setup Guide](./docs/guides/state-setup-guide.md).

The architecture is being proven through [steel thread prototypes](./docs/architecture/roadmap.md) that exercise the most complex parts of the design before domains are built out at scale.
