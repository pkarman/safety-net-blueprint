# Workflow Domain: Feature Design Reference

A feature-by-feature reference for the workflow contract architecture. For each capability, this document describes what the blueprint provides, how comparable systems handle the same problem, the trade-offs behind our design choices, and where states are expected to customize via overlays.

See [Workflow Domain](workflow.md) for the architecture overview and [Contract-Driven Architecture](../contract-driven-architecture.md) for the adapter pattern.

## Task lifecycle states

The task status enum defines the complete set of states a task can occupy. States are explicit fields on the Task resource — not derived from timestamps or other computed values.

**We support:** `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `escalated`, `cancelled`, `awaiting_client`, `awaiting_verification`, `pending_review`

| Concept | JSM | ServiceNow | Curam | Salesforce Gov Cloud | WS-HumanTask |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Waiting for client action | Waiting for Customer | On Hold / Awaiting Caller | Manual activity pending in inbox | Waiting on Someone Else | Suspended |
| Waiting for third-party verification | Pending | On Hold / Awaiting Evidence | Suspended process | Deferred | Suspended |
| Escalated | Escalated (built-in) | Custom via priority + routing | Supervisor queue routing | Custom escalation rule | — |
| Cancelled | Cancelled (terminal) | Canceled (terminal) | Aborted process | Cancelled | Obsolete / Exited |

**In safety net benefits processing:**

| State | Typical use |
|---|---|
| `pending` | New SNAP application review task created when application is submitted; waiting in queue to be claimed |
| `in_progress` | Caseworker actively reviewing application documents, verifying income, conducting interview |
| `awaiting_client` | Caseworker requested additional documentation (pay stubs, proof of address, identity docs); task blocked until client responds |
| `awaiting_verification` | Caseworker queried IEVS or FDSH to verify income/employment; task blocked until verification service returns results |
| `escalated` | SNAP expedited case approaching 7-day deadline; supervisor notified to intervene |
| `pending_review` | Caseworker completed eligibility determination; supervisor must approve before benefits are authorized |
| `cancelled` | Client withdrew application; case closed administratively; duplicate task created in error |
| `completed` | Eligibility determination finalized — benefits approved, denied, or pended for further review |

**Design decisions:**

- **Explicit state over derived state.** All major systems model task state as an explicit field. Deriving state from timestamps (e.g., "if `completedAt` is set, status is completed") is fragile and makes transitions ambiguous.
- **Separate `awaiting_client` and `awaiting_verification` rather than a single `on_hold`.** These states have different SLA accountability (client delay vs. third-party delay), different resolution paths (client provides documents vs. verification service returns), and different regulatory implications. Federal regulations distinguish between client-caused and agency-caused processing delays for SLA purposes. ServiceNow collapses them into `on_hold` sub-reasons; we make them first-class states to improve clarity and enable distinct timer behavior.
- **Status values use snake_case.** Consistent with the blueprint's JSON API conventions and widely used in government API contexts (GitHub, Stack Exchange, Twitter). OpenAPI places no constraint on enum value casing; code generators map to language-appropriate forms (e.g., `InProgress` in TypeScript).
- **`cancelled` has a `reopen` transition.** Supervisor can reinstate a cancelled task to `pending`, re-evaluating assignment and priority rules on reopen. Matches ServiceNow and Curam behavior.
- **`pending_review` enables structured supervisor sign-off.** A caseworker submits their determination via `submit-for-review`; the supervisor either `approve`s (→ `completed`) or `return-to-worker`s (→ `in_progress`). Common in SNAP and Medicaid where quality control requirements mandate supervisor approval before a determination is finalized. This is distinct from escalation — escalation is upward for help; review is a structured approval gate.
- **`escalated` keeps SLA clock running.** Escalation signals urgency but does not pause the clock — the work is still the agency's responsibility. Compare to `awaiting_client` which pauses the clock because the delay is external.

**Customization points:**
- States can add their own status values via overlay (e.g., `awaiting_supervisor`, `returned`).
- `slaClock` behavior per state can be overridden (e.g., a state may prefer to stop rather than pause the clock for `awaiting_client`, treating client delay as the client's time to spend).
- States needing tiered escalation (L1 → L2 → L3, as in JSM and ServiceNow) can add intermediate escalation states via overlay (e.g., `escalated_l2`, `escalated_supervisor`, `escalated_director`) with their own transitions and guards.

---

## SLA clock management

Each state declares its effect on the SLA clock. This value is consumed by the [SLA clock enforcement](#sla-clock-enforcement) service to pause or stop the clock when tasks enter certain states.

**We support:** `slaClock: running | paused | stopped` on every state (required)

| State | Clock behavior | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `pending` | running | Deadline starts at creation |
| `in_progress` | running | Work is actively in progress |
| `escalated` | running | Still agency's responsibility |
| `awaiting_client` | paused | External dependency; clock resumes when client responds |
| `awaiting_verification` | paused | External dependency; clock resumes when verification returns |
| `pending_review` | running | Supervisor review; deadline continues |
| `completed` | stopped | Work is done |
| `cancelled` | stopped | Work is abandoned; `reopen` transition returns to `pending` |

| Concept | JSM | ServiceNow | Curam |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pause SLA | "Pending" status excludes from SLA timers | On Hold sub-reasons pause SLA | SLA tracked at process level, not task state |
| Stop SLA | Resolved / Closed | Resolved / Closed / Canceled | Process completed / aborted |
| Business hours | Configurable per SLA | Configurable per schedule | Configurable per deadline |

**In safety net benefits processing:**

Federal and state regulations set processing deadlines that the SLA clock must reflect accurately:

- **SNAP**: 30 calendar days for standard applications; 7 calendar days for expedited. Clock runs from application receipt. Time spent waiting for client-provided documentation is typically excluded from the agency's deadline — making `awaiting_client: paused` the correct behavior under federal rules.
- **Medicaid**: 45 calendar days for most applications; 90 days for disability-based. States must document clock pause reasons for federal reporting.
- **TANF/Cash assistance**: Varies by state, typically 30–45 days. Some states use business days; the `calendarType` field on timer transitions accommodates this.

The distinction between `paused` (clock resumes from same point) and `stopped` (clock resets) matters for federal reporting — pausing preserves the original deadline, stopping would grant a fresh deadline on every block/resume cycle and distort SLA metrics.

**Design decisions:**

- **`slaClock` is required on every state.** Making it optional creates ambiguity — if a state has no `slaClock` value, is the clock running or stopped? Requiring explicit declaration forces intentional choices and prevents silent regressions when new states are added.
- **`paused` vs. `stopped` for waiting states.** `paused` means the clock resumes from where it left off. `stopped` means the clock resets. Paused is appropriate for external dependencies where the agency wants to reclaim that time. Stopped would effectively give the agency a fresh deadline on every block/resume cycle, which distorts SLA metrics and federal reporting.
- **`pending_review` clock runs during supervisor review.** Supervisor review time counts against the agency's deadline — the work is still in-flight from a regulatory standpoint. JSM and ServiceNow do not pause external SLA timers during approval states. States where regulation explicitly excludes review time from the deadline can override via overlay.

**Customization points:**
- States can override `slaClock` per state via overlay. A state that treats client non-response differently (e.g., stops rather than pauses) can do so without touching the baseline.
- The actual clock-pause/resume/stop logic lives in the [SLA clock enforcement](#sla-clock-enforcement) service. The `slaClock` value is the declaration of intent; the service is the enforcer.

## Transitions and effects

Transitions define valid state changes. Each transition has a trigger (which becomes an RPC endpoint), optional guards (preconditions), and effects (side effects that fire when the transition executes).

**We support:** `set`, `create`, `evaluate-rules`, `event`, `lookup` effect types; `when` (JSON Logic) for conditional effects; actor-triggered and timer-triggered transitions.

| Concept | JSM | ServiceNow | Camunda | WS-HumanTask |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Transition trigger | Status transition button | State flow trigger | Sequence flow / signal | Claim, start, complete, skip operations |
| Precondition | Validator condition | Condition script | Gateway condition | Constraints (potential owners, etc.) |
| Side effect on transition | Post-function | Business Rule | Execution Listener | Task handler |
| Conditional effect | — | Condition on Business Rule | Expression on Listener | — |

**In safety net benefits processing:**

Common transition patterns in benefits casework:

| Trigger | Typical benefits scenario |
|---|---|
| `claim` | Caseworker picks up a SNAP application review task from the intake queue |
| `complete` | Caseworker finalizes eligibility determination with outcome (approved/denied/pended) |
| `await-client` | Caseworker sends an RFI (Request for Information) — e.g., missing pay stubs or ID documents |
| `await-verification` | Caseworker submits income query to IEVS or requests wage data from FDSH |
| `system-resume` | IEVS or FDSH returns verification results; task automatically unblocked |
| `escalate` | Expedited SNAP case approaching 7-day deadline; caseworker flags for supervisor |
| `submit-for-review` | Caseworker completes determination write-up and submits for supervisor quality review |
| `approve` | Supervisor signs off on determination; benefits authorized |
| `return-to-worker` | Supervisor identifies documentation gap or policy question; returns to caseworker |
| `cancel` | Client withdrawal received; application closed per client request |
| `reopen` | Supervisor reinstates erroneously cancelled task |

**Design decisions:**

- **Triggers become RPC endpoints.** `claim` → `POST /tasks/:id/claim`. This is explicit, discoverable, and maps cleanly to audit events. Contrast with PATCH-based state updates, which are harder to guard, audit, and extend with request bodies.
- **Effects are declarative.** The state machine YAML declares what happens; implementations execute it. This makes the contract inspectable and portable across adapter implementations.
- **`when` conditions use JSON Logic.** Already a project dependency (rules engine uses it). Consistent, evaluatable by tooling, and avoids introducing a scripting language.
- **`from` accepts a string or array of strings.** Some transitions logically originate from multiple states — `cancel` can fire from `pending`, `in_progress`, or `escalated`. Without array support, each source state requires a separate transition block with identical effects. Allowing `from: [pending, in_progress, escalated]` eliminates this duplication and makes multi-source transitions readable as a single entry.
- **`return-to-worker` returns to `in_progress`.** When a supervisor returns work for revision, the task stays with the same caseworker. Returning to `pending` would force an unnecessary re-claim and break the revision cycle — the same person who did the work should revise it.
- **`de-escalate` returns to `pending`.** De-escalation re-queues the task rather than returning it directly to `in_progress`. This handles both source cases cleanly: tasks escalated from `in_progress` (assigned worker) can be immediately re-claimed; tasks escalated from `pending` (no assigned worker) re-queue without leaving the task in an inconsistent `in_progress`-with-no-owner state. Consistent with `reopen → pending` and `release → pending`.
- **`reopen` returns to `pending`.** A cancelled task re-enters the queue rather than being assigned back to the original worker. Cancellation implies closure; reopen starts fresh, re-evaluating assignment and priority rules.
- **`cancel` requires supervisor authorization.** Workers cannot cancel tasks directly. Given the regulatory implications of closing a benefits application (federal reporting, client appeal rights), cancellation is restricted to supervisors. States that want a worker-initiated request with supervisor approval can model this via a custom `request-cancel` state.
- **No notification effect type.** Domain events are emitted on every transition (providing an integration hook), but there is no built-in `notify` effect. JSM, ServiceNow, and Curam all have built-in notification on escalation. States that need push notifications should build notification services that subscribe to domain events. A `notify` effect type is future work.

**Customization points:**
- States can add effects to existing transitions via overlay (e.g., send a notice to the client when `await-client` fires).
- States can add new transitions (e.g., a `pend` transition for applications requiring additional review before determination).

## Timer-triggered transitions

Timer transitions fire automatically when a duration elapses, without requiring an actor to make an API call. They cover regulatory deadline enforcement and client-response timeouts.

**We support:** `on: timer`, `after` (duration string), `relativeTo` (task field or `slaDeadline`), `calendarType: calendar | business`

| Concept | JSM | ServiceNow | Curam |
|---|---|---|---|
| Time-based transition | SLA timer → auto-transition on breach | Escalation rule with time condition | Deadline escalation on process |
| Business vs. calendar time | Configurable per SLA | Configurable per schedule | Configurable per deadline |
| Relative to deadline | SLA breach point | SLA breach point | Process deadline |

**Example timer transitions in the baseline:**

| Trigger | From | To | After | Relative to | Calendar type |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `auto-escalate` | `pending` | `escalated` | 72h | `createdAt` | business |
| `auto-escalate-sla-warning` | `in_progress` | `escalated` | -48h | `slaDeadline` | calendar |
| `auto-cancel-awaiting-client` | `awaiting_client` | `cancelled` | 30d | `blockedAt` | calendar |
| `auto-resume-awaiting-verification` | `awaiting_verification` | `in_progress` | 7d | `blockedAt` | calendar |

**In safety net benefits processing:**

Timer triggers are especially important in benefits processing because regulatory deadlines are not advisory — missing them has federal compliance consequences:

- **SNAP standard (30 days)**: `auto-escalate-sla-warning` fires 48 hours before the SLA deadline so supervisors can intervene before a breach. `auto-escalate` fires if a task sits in `pending` for 72 business hours without being claimed.
- **SNAP expedited (7 days)**: States should configure a separate, shorter `auto-escalate` threshold for expedited tasks — e.g., 24 business hours. The baseline 72h value is a placeholder; overlay configuration is expected.
- **Client non-response (awaiting_client)**: Federal SNAP regulations allow agencies to close applications after 30 days of client non-response. `auto-cancel-awaiting-client` implements this automatically, with the domain event providing an audit trail for federal reporting.
- **Verification timeout (awaiting_verification)**: If IEVS or FDSH doesn't return results within 7 days, `auto-resume-awaiting-verification` unblocks the task so the caseworker can proceed with available information — consistent with policy that allows agencies to proceed without third-party data after reasonable waiting periods.

**Design decisions:**

- **`calendarType` is explicit per transition.** Regulatory deadlines (SNAP 30-day determination) are calendar days. Staffing SLAs are typically business hours. Conflating them produces incorrect enforcement and federal reporting errors.
- **`relativeTo: slaDeadline` enables proactive escalation.** Rather than only reacting after a deadline is missed, a negative duration (e.g., `-48h`) fires before the deadline. This is how JSM and ServiceNow prevent breaches rather than just recording them.
- **`auto-escalate-sla-warning` changes state rather than sending a notification.** JSM issues a notification for SLA warnings without changing task status. ServiceNow auto-escalates the record on breach. We follow the ServiceNow model — the state change + domain event creates a clear audit trail and triggers assignment/priority re-evaluation without requiring a separate notification integration. States that prefer notification-only can remove this timer via overlay.
- **Duration values in the baseline are illustrative.** The correct thresholds vary by program type, jurisdiction, and policy. All timer durations are expected to be overridden via state overlays.

**Customization points:**
- All `after` durations are overlay points — states set their own thresholds per program type and regulatory requirement.
- States should configure separate timer thresholds for expedited vs. standard cases (different SLA deadlines).
- `calendarType` can be overridden per transition.
- Timer transitions support an optional `guards` field for conditional suppression — e.g., skip `auto-escalate` for tasks already flagged by a supervisor.

**Known limitations:**
- **No SLA breach transition.** `auto-escalate-sla-warning` fires 48 hours before the deadline and moves the task to `escalated`, but nothing fires at the actual breach moment (0h). ServiceNow fires a distinct breach escalation. A future `auto-escalate-sla-breach` timer (from `escalated`, `after: 0h relativeTo: slaDeadline`) would close this gap and provide a distinct domain event for federal breach reporting.

## Guards and access control

Guards are named preconditions on transitions. A transition only fires if all its guards pass.

**We support:** simple `field/operator/value` guards; composition operators (`any`, `all`) at the transition level for OR/AND conditions across named guards.

| Concept | JSM | ServiceNow | Camunda | WS-HumanTask |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Precondition | Validator (Groovy/JS) | Condition script (JS) | Expression language (JUEL/SpEL) | Deployment/routing constraints |
| Role check | Project role condition | Role condition | Candidate group check | Potential owners list |
| Compound condition | Multiple validators | Multiple conditions | Composite expression | — |

**Guard examples in the baseline:**

| Guard | Expression | Used on |
|---|---|---|
| `taskIsUnassigned` | `assignedToId is_null` | `claim` |
| `callerIsAssignedWorker` | `assignedToId == $caller.id` | `complete`, `release`, `await-client`, etc. |
| `callerIsSupervisor` | `$caller.role == supervisor` | `cancel`, `de-escalate`, `approve`, `return-to-worker` |
| `callerIsSystem` | `$caller.type == system` | `system-resume` |

Compound conditions use composition at the transition level rather than in the guard definition itself. For example, `escalate` uses `any: [callerIsAssignedWorker, callerIsSupervisor]` — keeping named guards simple and composable.

**In safety net benefits processing:**

Role separation is embedded in federal and state program regulations:

- **Caseworker vs. supervisor authority**: SNAP and Medicaid quality control requirements restrict who can authorize eligibility determinations. The `callerIsSupervisor` guard on `approve` enforces this at the contract level, so all adapter implementations enforce the same boundary regardless of the underlying technology.
- **Automated verification systems**: IEVS, FDSH, and state data hubs (e.g., state wage records, SOLQ for SSA data) operate as system actors — they are not human caseworkers. The `callerIsSystem` guard on `system-resume` explicitly distinguishes automated verification callbacks from human actions, which is important for audit trails and federal reporting.
- **Self-assignment control**: `taskIsUnassigned` on `claim` prevents multiple caseworkers from simultaneously claiming the same task — a common issue in queue-based benefits processing without it.

**Design decisions:**

- **Guard composition over embedded expressions.** Rather than embedding JSON Logic inside guard definitions, compound conditions are expressed as `any`/`all` operators at the transition level, composing named simple guards. This keeps guard definitions readable (`field/operator/value`) and makes composition explicit and inspectable at the transition — consistent with how XState and similar declarative state machine systems handle compound preconditions.
- **`callerIsSupervisor` is a stub.** The guard references `$caller.role`, which is a convention for what the [role-based access control](#role-based-access-control) service will expose. Until then, enforcement is at the service layer. The guard is named and wired so implementations know where to plug in.
- **`callerIsSystem` enables automated verification resumption.** Benefits processing relies on external verification services (IEVS, FDSH, state data hubs) that return results asynchronously. A separate `system-resume` trigger (rather than relaxing the human `resume` guard) keeps domain events distinguishable and allows the request body to carry verification result data (source, result summary).
- **Named guards are reusable.** Defining guards at the top of the state machine and referencing them by name on transitions avoids duplicating conditions and makes the intent legible.
- **`await-client` and `await-verification` are caseworker-only.** Putting a task into a waiting state reflects a caseworker's knowledge of the case. Supervisors who need to block a task can reassign it, or states can add `callerIsSupervisor` to these guards via overlay.
- **Guards are per-transition, not per-state.** There is no way to declare "any transition into `pending_review` requires supervisor." Each transition must include its own guards. This is standard for declarative state machines but requires discipline when adding new transitions — a missing guard is a silent gap in access control. A future schema enhancement (`entryGuards` on states) could enforce this at the contract level.

**Customization points:**
- States can add guards to existing transitions via overlay (e.g., restrict `claim` to workers assigned to the correct program team).
- States can define additional named guards for their custom transitions.
- Once [role-based access control](#role-based-access-control) is implemented, `callerIsSupervisor` can be tightened to reference the real role model without changing transition definitions.

## Rules engine

Rules determine task routing (assignment) and prioritization without hardcoding logic in the state machine. They are evaluated by `evaluate-rules` effects.

**We support:** `assignment` and `priority` rule sets; JSON Logic conditions; `first-match-wins` evaluation; `evaluate-rules` effect with `ruleType`

| Concept | JSM | ServiceNow | Camunda | WfMC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Routing rules | Automation rules | Assignment rules | Task listener / routing | Participant resolution |
| Priority rules | Priority field automation | SLA-based priority | — | — |
| Rule order | First matching automation | Rule processing order | — | — |

**In safety net benefits processing:**

Assignment and priority rules encode program-specific routing logic that varies significantly across states and program types:

- **Assignment rules**: Route SNAP tasks to the SNAP intake queue, Medicaid tasks to the Medicaid eligibility queue, and TANF tasks to the cash assistance queue. Expedited SNAP applications may route to a dedicated expedited queue staffed for 7-day processing. Complex cases (e.g., households with multiple programs) may route to a specialized multi-program team.
- **Priority rules**: Set `priority: expedited` when `isExpedited == true` (7-day SNAP clock). Set `priority: high` for cases approaching their SLA deadline. Set `priority: normal` as default. States commonly add program-specific priority logic — e.g., prioritizing cases with young children or disability flags.
- **Re-evaluation triggers**: Rules re-evaluate on `onCreate` (initial routing), `release` (task returned to queue), `escalate` (priority may change), and `onUpdate` for `isExpedited` field changes (e.g., a supervisor marks a standard case as expedited after submission).

**Design decisions:**

- **Rules live in a separate YAML file, not inline in the state machine.** `workflow-rules.yaml` is entirely replaceable per state. This makes state customization straightforward — a state drops in their own rules file without touching the state machine.
- **`first-match-wins`.** Simple, predictable, and easy to debug. Rules are evaluated in `order` and the first match wins. States that need more complex routing (e.g., weighted load balancing) can implement that as a rule action.
- **`evaluate-rules` is called from the state machine, not from rules.** The state machine declares when rules run (`onCreate`, `release`, `escalate`); the rules engine decides what happens. This keeps the two concerns cleanly separated.
- **Rules are not hardcoded effects.** `evaluate-rules: priority` on `escalate` lets the rules engine decide what escalation means for priority — rather than hardcoding `set priority: high`. A state serving both standard and expedited cases may want different escalation priority behavior per program.

**Customization points:**
- States replace `workflow-rules.yaml` entirely with their own assignment and priority rules.
- States can add `evaluate-rules` effects to additional transitions via overlay.

---

## Lifecycle hooks (`onCreate`, `onUpdate`)

Lifecycle hooks fire effects at key moments in the object's life independent of specific transitions.

**We support:** `onCreate` (fires on creation), `onUpdate` (fires on field changes, scoped by `fields` filter)

| Concept | JSM | ServiceNow | Camunda | BPMN |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| On creation | — | Business Rule on insert | Start event listener | Start event |
| On field change | — | Business Rule on update | Execution listener on variable change | Data Object change event |

**In safety net benefits processing:**

- **`onCreate`**: When a new task is created (e.g., triggered by application submission via [cross-domain event wiring](#cross-domain-event-wiring)), assignment and priority rules evaluate immediately so the task lands in the right queue with the right priority before any caseworker sees it.
- **`onUpdate` for `isExpedited`**: If a supervisor manually flags a task as expedited after initial routing (e.g., a client reveals a crisis situation), `onUpdate` re-evaluates priority rules and potentially re-routes the task to the expedited queue — without requiring a state transition.
- **`onUpdate` for `programType`**: If a task's program type is corrected (e.g., application was initially categorized as SNAP but is actually a combined SNAP/Medicaid application), assignment rules re-evaluate to route to the correct team.

**Design decisions:**

- **`onUpdate` has a `fields` filter.** Without scoping, `onUpdate` fires on every PATCH, including updates made by transitions themselves — creating potential loops. The `fields` list explicitly declares which field changes have downstream effects, which also serves as documentation.
- **`onUpdate` fires on external updates only.** Transition-driven field changes (e.g., `set assignedToId` on `claim`) do not trigger `onUpdate`. This prevents cascading re-evaluation during transitions.

**Customization points:**
- States can add `onUpdate` effects via overlay (e.g., send a supervisor alert when `priority` changes to `expedited`).
- States can extend the `fields` list to react to additional field changes.

---

## Domain events

Every state machine transition and lifecycle hook emits an immutable domain event via the `event` effect. Events are the audit trail and the integration surface for cross-domain communication.

**We support:** `event` effect type with `action` and optional `data` payload; read-only Events API (`GET /events`, `GET /events/stream` SSE, `GET /events/:id`)

| Concept | JSM | ServiceNow | Camunda | WfMC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Transition audit | Issue history | Audit log | User Operation Log | Task Event History |
| Real-time stream | Webhooks | Event Management | Process event stream | — |
| Immutable log | Read-only history | Read-only audit | History service | — |

**In safety net benefits processing:**

Domain events serve two roles in benefits programs: audit trail and cross-domain integration.

- **Audit trail**: Federal and state regulations require documentation of eligibility determinations, including who acted, when, and why. Events like `task.approved`, `task.cancelled` (with reason), and `task.system_resumed` (with source and result) provide the granular record needed for quality control reviews, federal audits, and fair hearings.
- **Cross-domain integration** (via [cross-domain event wiring](#cross-domain-event-wiring)): `task.completed` consumed by the eligibility domain to trigger benefit issuance. `task.awaiting_client` consumed by the communication domain to send an RFI notice to the client. `task.auto_cancelled` consumed by the case management domain to update case status.
- **Real-time supervisor dashboards**: The SSE stream (`GET /events/stream`) allows supervisor workload dashboards to update in real time as tasks are claimed, escalated, or completed — without polling.

**Design decisions:**

- **Single events collection across all domains.** Events are identified by `domain`, `resource`, and `action`. This makes cross-domain queries possible (e.g., "show all events for this person across case management and workflow") without joining separate event stores.
- **Read-only API.** Events are never POST'd, PATCH'd, or DELETE'd via the API. Mutations to the audit trail are not permitted.
- **`event` effects declare the action name and data.** The state machine YAML is the authoritative source for what events exist and what they carry. Implementations derive event schema from the contract.

**Customization points:**
- States can add additional `event` effects to transitions via overlay (e.g., include the client's case number in the `completed` event payload for easier cross-referencing).
- Cross-domain event consumers subscribe to specific `action` values — adding new actions is non-breaking.

---

## Known gaps and future considerations

| Gap | Industry norm | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Batch/bulk transitions | Bulk reassignment common in queue management | Not in scope; likely a separate batch endpoint |
| Skill-based assignment | Round-robin, least-loaded, skill-match routing | Rules engine supports it; no built-in actions yet |
| Notification effects | Notify client on `await-client`; notify supervisor on escalation | Out of scope; cross-cutting concern (communication domain) |
| `$caller.role` enforcement | Role checks are named stubs; see [Role-based access control](#role-based-access-control) | Planned |
| SLA clock enforcement | `slaClock` values are defined on all states; enforcement not yet implemented; see [SLA clock enforcement](#sla-clock-enforcement) | Planned |
| Cross-domain task creation | Application submitted → review task auto-created; see [Cross-domain event wiring](#cross-domain-event-wiring) | Planned |

---

## SLA clock enforcement

> **Status: Planned.** The `slaClock` values on states are in place. The enforcement logic is not yet implemented.

The SLA clock enforcement service reads `slaClock` values from the state machine and manages a per-task clock that tracks time against a program-specific deadline. It is responsible for:

- Starting the clock when a task is created
- Pausing the clock when a task enters `awaiting_client` or `awaiting_verification`
- Resuming the clock when a task returns to `in_progress` via `resume` or `system-resume`
- Stopping the clock when a task reaches `completed` or `cancelled`
- Providing the `slaDeadline` value used by timer-triggered transitions (e.g., `auto-escalate-sla-warning`)

**Interface with the state machine:**

- `slaClock: running | paused | stopped` on each state — declaration of intent consumed by the SLA service
- `relativeTo: slaDeadline` on timer transitions — requires the SLA service to expose the deadline as a resolvable value
- `lookup` effect type — planned mechanism for transitions to retrieve SLA configuration (deadline length by program type and task type)

**In safety net benefits processing:**

SLA deadlines vary by program and task type. The service must be configurable per state:

| Program | Standard deadline | Expedited deadline |
|---|---|---|
| SNAP | 30 calendar days | 7 calendar days |
| Medicaid | 45 calendar days (90 for disability) | — |
| TANF / Cash assistance | Varies by state (typically 30–45 days) | — |
| CHIP | 45 calendar days | — |

States configure deadline lengths via SLA type definitions. The baseline provides illustrative values; states are expected to supply their own via overlay.

---

## Role-based access control

> **Status: Planned.** Guards referencing `$caller.role` and `$caller.type` are named and wired. Enforcement is at the service layer until this capability is implemented.

The RBAC system provides the execution context values (`$caller.role`, `$caller.type`, `$caller.id`) that guards evaluate against. It is responsible for:

- Authenticating callers and resolving their role (caseworker, supervisor, system)
- Injecting caller context into the state machine execution environment
- Enforcing role checks declared in guard expressions

**Interface with the state machine:**

Guards reference caller context via `$caller.*` variables. The conventions used in the baseline:

| Variable | Expected values | Used in |
|---|---|---|
| `$caller.id` | UUID of the authenticated user | `callerIsAssignedWorker` |
| `$caller.role` | `caseworker`, `supervisor` | `callerIsSupervisor`, `callerIsAssignedWorkerOrSupervisor` |
| `$caller.type` | `human`, `system` | `callerIsSystem` |

**In safety net benefits processing:**

Role separation is required by federal quality control regulations in SNAP and Medicaid. A caseworker cannot approve their own determination — that requires a supervisor. States are expected to define their own role hierarchy and map it to the `supervisor` value used in the guard, which may include roles like eligibility supervisor, unit manager, or quality control reviewer.

---

## Cross-domain event wiring

> **Status: Planned.** The domain events infrastructure is in place. The wiring that allows events from other domains to trigger workflow task creation is not yet implemented.

Cross-domain event wiring allows the workflow domain to react to events emitted by other domains — creating tasks automatically rather than requiring manual task creation via the API. It is responsible for:

- Subscribing to domain events from other domains (e.g., intake, case management, scheduling)
- Mapping incoming events to task creation payloads
- Triggering `onCreate` effects (assignment rules, priority rules, domain event emission) for each created task

**Interface with the state machine:**

Tasks created via cross-domain wiring go through the same `onCreate` lifecycle as manually created tasks — assignment and priority rules evaluate immediately, and a `task.created` domain event is emitted.

**In safety net benefits processing:**

Common cross-domain triggers that should automatically create workflow tasks:

| Triggering event | Domain | Task created |
|---|---|---|
| `application.submitted` | Intake | SNAP/Medicaid/TANF application review task |
| `application.submitted` (expedited) | Intake | Expedited SNAP review task (routed to expedited queue) |
| `case.recertification_due` | Case Management | Recertification review task |
| `appointment.no_show` | Scheduling | Follow-up outreach task |
| `document.received` | Document Management | Document review task (may resume `awaiting_client` task) |
| `verification.result_received` | External (IEVS/FDSH) | Triggers `system-resume` on existing `awaiting_verification` task |
