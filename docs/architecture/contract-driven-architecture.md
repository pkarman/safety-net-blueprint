## Context

Safety net program implementations depend on a range of backend systems and must render context-dependent UI across multiple programs. This project uses a contract-driven architecture to achieve portability at both layers — APIs and UI are defined as contracts, and implementations are swappable without changing what depends on them.

At the **backend**, contracts provide vendor independence. The adapter pattern translates between contracts and vendor-specific systems — swap vendors by reimplementing the adapter, not the frontend. The contract complexity varies by system type: **data-shaped** systems (databases, document stores, identity providers) need only an API interface (OpenAPI spec), while **behavior-shaped** systems (workflow engines, rules engines, notification platforms) need richer behavioral contracts — state machines, rules, and metrics — that capture what the system must enforce, decide, and measure.

At the **frontend**, field metadata contracts provide independence from domain-specific rendering logic. The backend serves field-level metadata — annotations (program relevance, verification requirements, regulatory citations), permissions, and labels — as contract artifacts. The frontend consumes this metadata to render context-dependent UI without hardcoding decisions about what to show based on programs, roles, or eligibility groups. Adding a program or changing which fields a role sees is a contract change, not a code change. Form rendering and layout are frontend concerns handled by the [safety-net-harness](https://github.com/codeforamerica/safety-net-harness) packages.

This proposal describes how to define contracts for both layers, organized around two API types. **REST** (Representational State Transfer) APIs model resources with standard CRUD operations — create, read, update, delete. These serve data-shaped domains where the value is in the data model itself. **RPC** (Remote Procedure Call) APIs expose named operations that trigger behavior — state transitions, rule evaluation, and side effects. These serve behavior-shaped domains where the value is in orchestration and enforcement. The contract complexity differs: REST APIs need only an interface definition, while RPC APIs need richer behavioral contracts.

## Contract Artifacts

Every domain needs contracts. What contracts you need depends on whether the domain is data-shaped or behavior-shaped — which maps to REST and RPC.

### REST APIs

REST APIs are CRUD operations on resources — create, read, update, delete, list, search. Every domain has these. The contract is an OpenAPI spec that defines the resource schemas, endpoints, and query parameters.

**Examples:**
- `GET /persons`, `POST /persons`, `GET /persons/:id`
- `GET /applications`, `POST /applications`
- `GET /workflow/tasks`, `GET /workflow/queues`

REST APIs are straightforward to make portable. A `Person` looks the same regardless of whether it's stored in PostgreSQL, Salesforce, or a legacy system. The adapter maps between the OpenAPI contract and the vendor's data model.

Some domains only need REST APIs — persons, applications, households, income, documents. The data model is the value, and CRUD is the full interface. These domains need one contract artifact:

- **OpenAPI spec** — resource schemas, endpoints, query parameters

### RPC APIs

RPC APIs are behavioral operations — they trigger state transitions, enforce business rules, and produce side effects. Some domains need these in addition to REST APIs.

**Examples:**
- `POST /workflow/tasks/:id/claim` — transitions a task from `pending` to `in_progress`, enforces assignment rules
- `POST /workflow/tasks/:id/escalate` — transitions to `escalated`, creates audit event, may trigger notifications
- `POST /workflow/tasks/:id/complete` — validates the caller is the assignee, transitions to `completed`

RPC APIs are harder to make portable because the value is in orchestration and enforcement, not just data. A workflow engine provides state machine enforcement, task routing, SLA tracking, auto-escalation, audit trails, and event-driven triggers. A rules engine provides evaluation, conflict resolution, and explanation capabilities. A notification system provides multi-channel orchestration, retry logic, and delivery tracking.

A generic CRUD adapter loses most of this value. The adapter pattern still applies, but the contract needs to be richer than just an OpenAPI spec. RPC API domains need two or more contract artifacts:

- **OpenAPI spec** — same resource schemas used by the REST APIs
- **State machine YAML** (required) — valid states, transitions, guards, effects, timeouts, SLA behavior, audit requirements, notification triggers, and event catalog
- **Rules YAML** (optional) — declarative rules with logic conditions and actions. Rule types include assignment, priority, eligibility, escalation, alert, and more. Only needed when the domain involves condition-based decisions beyond what guards express (e.g., routing objects to queues based on context, setting priority based on application data, alert thresholds for operational monitoring).
- **Metrics YAML** (optional) — defines what to measure for operational monitoring. Metric names, labels, source linkage (which states/transitions produce the data), and targets — not implementation details (Prometheus vs. Datadog is a deployment concern).

Every behavior-shaped domain needs a state machine — that's what makes it behavior-shaped. Rules are an additional artifact for domains that need condition-based decisions evaluated against broader context. Metrics are an additional artifact for domains that need operational monitoring. For example, workflow management needs state machine + rules + metrics. A simple approval process may only need the state machine.

### Any domain: field metadata

Regardless of API type, any domain may also need:

- **Field metadata YAML** (optional) — defines field-level annotations (program relevance, verification requirements, regulatory citations), permissions, and labels/translations. Needed when fields carry context that varies by program, role, or eligibility group. The backend serves field metadata as a contract artifact; frontends and other consumers retrieve it via API. A data-shaped domain with multi-program field context needs OpenAPI + field metadata. A behavior-shaped domain like application review needs OpenAPI + state machine + field metadata. Form rendering and layout concerns (sections, navigation, component mapping) are handled by the frontend — see [safety-net-harness](https://github.com/codeforamerica/safety-net-harness).

---

## How the Contracts Work

Each contract artifact captures a different concern. **Behavioral contracts** (state machine, rules, metrics) define what the backend must enforce, decide, and measure — the adapter or vendor system interprets them. **Field metadata** defines what context accompanies each field — the backend serves it and frontends consume it. Together they cover both portability layers.

### State machine

The state machine YAML defines the lifecycle of an object — its states, transitions, who can trigger them, what conditions must hold, and what side effects must occur. It follows [statechart semantics](https://statecharts.dev/) written as custom YAML with a JSON Schema defining the format.

```yaml
# Simplified example — a task that can be claimed and completed
states:
  pending:
    transitions:
      - to: in_progress
        trigger: claim
        actors: [caseworker]
        guard: taskIsUnassigned
        effects:
          - set: { assignedToId: $caller.id }
          - create: TaskAuditEvent
          - notify: { channel: email, recipient: $object.supervisorId, template: task-claimed }

# Custom top-level field — added by the workflow domain to handle creation-time orchestration.
# Domains extend the base schema with fields like this as requirements emerge.
onCreate:
  effects:
    - evaluate-rules: workflow-rules    # References the rules YAML file
      description: Route task to queue and set priority
```

Each `trigger` becomes an RPC API endpoint — `claim` on `Task` in the `workflow` domain becomes `POST /workflow/tasks/:id/claim`. Effects are declarative side effects (create records, update fields, send notifications, evaluate rules) that must occur when a transition fires.

### Complex calculation logic

Some domains involve calculation logic beyond what the rules artifact is designed to express — eligibility determination, tax calculation, risk scoring. Where `evaluate-rules` invokes the portable rules YAML that ships with the contracts, a custom `call` effect type can be added for when the logic lives in a dedicated external engine. The contract defines when calculations happen (which transition), what goes in and comes out (OpenAPI schemas), and how results are audited (effects) — without prescribing how the calculations work. `call` is an example of extending the base effect types to meet domain-specific needs, the same way `onCreate` extends the base top-level fields.

### Rules

Rules are a separate YAML artifact for condition-based decisions — routing, assignment, prioritization, escalation, eligibility. The rules file is context-agnostic — it doesn't know what object it operates on. The state machine provides context when it fires an `evaluate-rules` effect: the governed entity is bound to a context variable, so the same rules structure could apply to tasks, applications, or any other object with the referenced fields. The binding name is domain-specific — `object` is used as a placeholder in these examples, but a real domain would use its own name (e.g., `task.*` in workflow, `application.*` in intake).

```yaml
# workflow-rules.yaml — referenced by: evaluate-rules: workflow-rules
route-snap-tasks:
  ruleType: assignment
  condition: { "==": [{ "var": "object.programCode" }, "SNAP"] }
  action: { assignToQueue: "snap-processing" }

high-priority-expedited:
  ruleType: priority
  condition: { "==": [{ "var": "object.isExpedited" }, true] }
  action: { setPriority: high }
```

Rule types (like `assignment` and `priority`) and what their actions mean (like `assignToQueue` and `setPriority`) are domain-specific — the exact schema for defining these is a design detail to be worked out during implementation. What the proposal establishes is the pattern: rules are declarative, keyed by ID (so state overlays can target individual rules), and invoked by the state machine via effects. Conditions need a portable, serializable expression format — [JSON Logic](https://jsonlogic.com/) is a lightweight option with implementations in most languages, though alternatives like CEL or FEEL could be substituted if more expressive power is needed. The contract YAML uses one canonical format so the shared tooling (mock server, validation, tests) only needs one evaluator. States that prefer a different expression language author in that language and have their conversion scripts translate to the canonical format when generating the YAML — the same tool-agnostic pattern used for authoring tools.

### Metrics

Metrics define what to measure — metric names, labels, targets, and where the data comes from. Each metric's `source` references specific states or transitions in the state machine by name, which is how the two artifacts link together. They specify *what* to measure, not *how* to collect it.

```yaml
# Simplified example — measure how long tasks wait before being claimed.
task-time-to-claim:
  description: Time from task creation to first claim
  source:
    from: pending          # State name from the state machine
    to: in_progress        # State name from the state machine
    trigger: claim         # Transition trigger name from the state machine
  target:
    p95: 4h                # 95th percentile target (also supports p50, p99, max, avg, etc.)
```

#### Standards alignment

The behavioral contract formats (state machine, rules, metrics) are custom YAML but informed by established standards. No single standard covers the full use case (declarative behavioral contracts for government benefits workflows, authored in tables, validated against OpenAPI specs), but the core patterns have well-known precedents.

| Our concept | Standard | How it aligns |
|---|---|---|
| States, transitions, guards, effects | [Statecharts](https://statecharts.dev/) / [SCXML](https://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/) (W3C) | Same formal model — finite states with guarded transitions and entry/exit actions. Our effects map to SCXML's executable content. |
| Trigger → RPC endpoint generation | [WS-HumanTask](http://docs.oasis-open.org/bpel4people/ws-humantask-1.1-spec-cs-01.html) (OASIS) | WS-HumanTask defines claim, complete, release, delegate as standard task operations. Our triggers mirror these. |
| SLA clock behavior (running/stopped/paused) | BPMN Timer Events, Camunda SLA tracking | Same concept — clock state tied to object state. BPMN uses timer boundary events; we use declarative per-state clock config. |
| Decision tables with first-match-wins | [DMN](https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/) (OMG) | DMN defines decision tables with hit policies (first, unique, any, collect). Our `first-match-wins` maps to DMN's "First" hit policy. |
| JSON Logic for conditions | [Form.io](https://form.io/), [json-logic-js](https://github.com/jwadhams/json-logic-js) | Lightweight, serializable expression format with broad adoption. Alternatives: CEL (more powerful), FEEL (DMN-native), FHIRPath (healthcare-specific). |
| Metrics with source linkage to states/transitions | [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) semantic conventions | Same pattern — metrics defined by what they measure (duration, count), linked to the operations that produce data. Our targets (p95, p50) align with standard histogram buckets. |
| Audit requirements as declarative spec | [OASIS WS-HumanTask](http://docs.oasis-open.org/bpel4people/ws-humantask-1.1-spec-cs-01.html) audit trail | WS-HumanTask mandates audit records for task state changes. Our `audit` block makes this a validatable contract requirement. |

**Design decisions:**

- **Why not SCXML?** SCXML is XML-based and designed for runtime execution, not table-based authoring. The semantics transfer; the format doesn't fit our YAML/spreadsheet pipeline.
- **Why not BPMN/Camunda format?** BPMN is a visual modeling standard with XML serialization. It's more expressive than we need (parallel gateways, message flows, subprocesses) and the tooling assumes a graphical editor. States that prefer Camunda Modeler can author in it and use conversion scripts to generate our YAML.
- **Why not DMN for rules?** DMN's FEEL expression language is more powerful than JSON Logic but has fewer lightweight implementations. JSON Logic is consistent with our field metadata conditions and has implementations in every major language. States can author in DMN and convert.

**Planned extensions (additive, no breaking changes):**

| Capability | How it extends the format | Standard precedent |
|---|---|---|
| Parallel/hierarchical states | Add `children` or `parallel` property to state definitions | SCXML `<parallel>`, statechart nested states |
| Timer/timeout transitions | Add `onTimeout` top-level field with duration and effects | BPMN timer boundary events, Camunda timer tasks |
| OR guard composition | Accept guard objects with `any`/`all` keys alongside current string refs | SCXML `<if>`/`<elseif>` compound conditions |
| Rule chaining | Add `next` property to ruleSets for sequential evaluation | DMN decision requirements graphs |
| Cross-domain rule context | Expand `context` bindings (e.g., `application.*` alongside `task.*`) | DMN business knowledge models |
| Notification effects | Add `notify` effect type with channel, recipient, template | WS-HumanTask notification tasks |

### Field metadata

Field metadata describes context-dependent information about fields — annotations (program relevance, verification requirements, regulatory citations), permissions, and labels/translations. Field metadata links to the OpenAPI spec (field names, types, enums), not the state machine — it's about what context accompanies data fields, not lifecycle.

```yaml
# Simplified example — field-level annotations for multi-program context
fields:
  income.amount:
    annotations:
      - type: relevance
        context: SNAP
        value: gross amount counted
      - type: relevance
        context: Medicaid
        value: net amount for MAGI
      - type: verification
        value: pay stub, employer letter, or tax return
      - type: regulation
        context: SNAP
        value: 7 CFR 273.9(a) — Gross income determination
    permissions:
      caseworker: read-write
      applicant: read-only
```

**Source paths** — Field metadata uses dot-notation paths to link to OpenAPI schema fields. The first segment is the schema name (e.g., `member` for ApplicationMember, `income` for Income); subsequent segments are field names, including nested paths (e.g., `member.citizenshipInfo.status`). The validation script verifies these paths resolve — if field metadata references a path that doesn't exist in the schema, validation fails.

**How field metadata is served:**

1. **Metadata API** — The backend serves field metadata via a dedicated endpoint (e.g., `GET /intake/field-metadata`). The frontend fetches this at load time and uses it to drive rendering decisions.

2. **Program requirements** — The server uses field metadata's program requirements to determine which records to create on submission (e.g., which SectionReview records to create based on which programs a member is applying for).

3. **Annotation consumption** — Consumers iterate over whatever annotation types exist and render them — they don't need to know what any specific annotation type means. Adding a new annotation type is a metadata change, not a code change.

The adapter's role is to serve field metadata to consumers (possibly after resolving state overlays) and to use parts of it for server-side logic (e.g., determining which records to create during `onCreate`). See [Extensibility and customization](#extensibility-and-customization) for how annotation types scale.

#### Standards alignment

The field metadata format is custom but informed by established standards. No single standard covers the full use case (field-level metadata with program-specific annotations for government benefits), but the core patterns have well-known precedents.

| Our concept | Standard | How it aligns |
|---|---|---|
| Field-level annotations as part of data model | [FHIR ElementDefinition](https://build.fhir.org/elementdefinition.html) | FHIR defines field-level constraints, labels, and extensions as part of the data model's StructureDefinition — metadata about fields served by the backend, not a frontend rendering concern. |
| Field-level permissions | [FHIR Security Labels](https://build.fhir.org/security-labels.html), [FHIR DS4P](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-security-label-ds4p/inline_security_labels.html) | FHIR uses inline security labels for element-level access control — field permissions as part of the data contract, enforced by the backend. |
| Multilingual labels | [FHIR Languages](https://build.fhir.org/languages.html) | FHIR defines multilingual designations served by the backend via CodeSystem and ValueSet resources — labels as backend-served metadata, not hardcoded in the frontend. |
| Field annotations (relevance, verification, regulatory citations) | FHIR Questionnaire [extensions](https://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire.html) | Novel — no standard has per-field annotations describing how different contexts use a field. FHIR's extension system is the closest model. Our approach is simpler: annotation types as table columns, scaling to a generalized annotations table. |
| JSON Logic as expression language | [Form.io](https://form.io/) conditional visibility, [SurveyJS](https://surveyjs.io/) | Form.io uses JSON Logic for advanced conditions — same library, same purpose. JSON Logic is lightweight, serializable, and has implementations in most languages. |

**Design decisions:**

- **Why field metadata in the backend, not form rendering?** Field metadata (what annotations a field carries, who can see it, what it's called in different languages) is data model metadata — it applies regardless of which frontend renders it. Form rendering (layout, sections, component mapping, navigation) is a frontend concern that varies by application. Separating them follows the same pattern as FHIR, where ElementDefinition is part of the data model and rendering is left to the presentation layer.
- **Why JSON Logic over alternatives?** JSON Logic is the lightest serializable expression language with broad adoption. Alternatives: FHIRPath (healthcare-specific), XPath (verbose, XML-oriented), CEL (more powerful but less adopted). JSON Logic fits our authoring model — conditions that non-developers can read in a table cell.

### Extensibility and customization

All contract artifacts — state machine, rules, metrics, field metadata — are declarative YAML governed by JSON Schema, making them diffable and reviewable in PRs. The common extensibility principle: adding capabilities means adding entries to existing structures (rows, fields, types), not restructuring the format. Consumers — adapters, frontends, validation scripts — iterate over whatever they find rather than hardcoding expectations about specific entries.

**State machine** — New effect types (e.g., `audit`, `notify`, `call`) are added to the schema and implemented as handlers in the adapter. Adding an effect type doesn't change existing transitions. New guard types (role-based, time-based, external service checks) follow the same pattern — the evaluation engine dispatches on guard type. Domains extend the base schema with top-level fields as requirements emerge (e.g., `onCreate`, `onTimeout`, `bulkActions`).

**Rules** — New decision tables are independent — adding a table doesn't affect existing ones. New condition operators or action types extend the rules schema without restructuring existing rules.

**Metrics** — New source types (state duration, transition count, field value aggregation) and new dimensions for slicing (by program, by worker, by time period) are additive. Adding a metric is adding rows to the metrics table.

**Field metadata** — Field-level annotations (program relevance, verification requirements, role-based guidance), permissions, and labels are extensible by type. Adding an annotation type means adding rows to an annotations table — consumers render whatever types they encounter without knowing what they mean. Annotation values can be structured — strings for simple guidance, arrays of acceptable items, or objects with links to external APIs, policy documents, or verification services. Authoring tables can use either format: columns for annotation types that apply to most fields, or a separate table for sparse types. Both produce the same generalized structure:

| Section | Field | Annotation Type | Context | Value |
|---------|-------|-----------------|---------|-------|
| income | amount | relevance | SNAP | gross amount counted |
| income | amount | relevance | Medicaid | net amount for MAGI |
| income | amount | verification | all | pay stub, employer letter, or tax return |
| income | amount | regulation | SNAP | 7 CFR 273.9(a) — Gross income determination |

Adding a new annotation type or a new audience adds rows — no structural change to the table or the consumers.

All artifacts include a `version` field for change tracking. The validation script can diff two versions of any artifact and report breaking vs. non-breaking changes — removing a state, transition, rule, metric, or form field is breaking; adding one is not. This applies consistently across all artifact types, the same way OpenAPI spec versioning works.

### Authoring experience

The YAML formats are build artifacts, not files that anyone edits by hand. Business users and developers author in tables (spreadsheets), and conversion scripts generate the YAML.

**Table-based workflow:** Each concern gets its own table — state transitions, guards, effects, decision rules, metrics. The tables are structured with enough detail for conversion scripts to generate YAML directly. In a spreadsheet, each table would be a separate sheet; the conversion script joins them by trigger or guard name.

Because the YAML is always generated from the tables, nobody edits it by hand. When a table row changes, the script regenerates the YAML. When a row is removed, the corresponding YAML is removed too — which is correct, since the transition or rule no longer exists.

**Example — separate tables for the same transition:**

*Transitions table:*

| From | To | Trigger | Who | Guard | Effects |
|------|-----|---------|-----|-------|---------|
| pending | in_progress | claim | caseworker | Task is unassigned | Assign to worker, create audit event |

*Guards table:*

| Guard | Field | Operator | Value |
|-------|-------|----------|-------|
| Task is unassigned | `assignedToId` | is null | — |

*Effects table:*

| Trigger | set | create |
|---------|-----|--------|
| claim | `assignedToId` = `$caller.id` | TaskAuditEvent (`assigned`) |

The same pattern applies to decision tables (conditions and actions with field references), metrics tables (metric names, source linkage to states and transitions, targets), and field metadata tables (annotations, permissions, labels).

**Tool-agnostic:** The conversion scripts are the integration point, not the authoring tool. The default workflow uses spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets), but if a state prefers Camunda Modeler for state machines or a DMN editor for rules, they need a conversion script for that tool's export format. The tool produces the business-level content; developer implementation details come from a companion source (additional columns, a separate sheet, or annotations in the tool — whatever fits). The output is always the same YAML.

## From Contracts to Implementation

### The adapter pattern

The adapter translates between contracts and vendor-specific systems. Swap vendors by reimplementing the adapter, not the frontend.

For **REST APIs**, the adapter wraps a vendor's data store with a standard interface defined by the OpenAPI spec. The frontend sees the same API regardless of what's behind the adapter.

```
[Frontend] → [Adapter] → [Vendor/DB]
                 ↑
              REST APIs (GET /tasks, POST /tasks)
```

For **RPC APIs**, the adapter wraps a vendor system (workflow engine, rules engine) and exposes both REST and RPC APIs. The frontend calls REST APIs for data reads (`GET /workflow/tasks`) and RPC APIs for behavioral operations (`POST /workflow/tasks/:id/claim`). The adapter translates both to the vendor's system.

```
[Frontend] ──────► [Adapter] ──────► [Vendor System]
                      ↑
                    REST APIs (GET /tasks, POST /tasks)
                    RPC APIs (POST /tasks/:id/claim)
```

The adapter must satisfy the contract artifacts for the domain — for RPC APIs, that means more than just an OpenAPI spec. When you switch vendors, the contracts tell you exactly what the new backend must do.

### Contracts as requirements

The behavioral contract defines **what must happen** — not how the adapter implements it. The adapter and vendor system together satisfy the contract, but how they divide the work depends on the vendor:

- **Full workflow/rules engine** (Camunda, Temporal, Drools) — The vendor handles state transitions, guards, effects, and timeouts natively. The adapter translates between the contract's HTTP surface and the vendor's APIs. The contract artifacts are configuration requirements for the vendor, not code the adapter executes.
- **Simple backend** (database + application code) — The adapter orchestrates the behavior itself: enforcing transitions, evaluating guards, running effects, tracking SLA clocks. The contract artifacts are a specification the adapter interprets directly.
- **Hybrid** — The vendor handles some concerns natively (e.g., state transitions, timeouts) while the adapter orchestrates others (e.g., cross-domain effects, rule evaluation).

So when the contract says "these effects must occur on this transition," it's a requirement, not an execution instruction. When `onCreate` says "evaluate routing rules and create an audit record after object creation," it specifies the required outcome — not that the adapter must intercept the POST and run effects itself. A workflow engine might handle this as a native initialization step. A simpler backend might have the adapter orchestrate the effects inline.

### Development to production

During development, the frontend talks to the mock server. In production, it talks to the production adapter:

```
Development:
  [Frontend] → [Mock Server] → [State Machine Engine + In-memory DB]

Production:
  [Frontend] → [Adapter] → [Vendor System]
                   ↑
           Validated against contract
```

The mock server is the development adapter. Swapping from mock to production changes the adapter internals, not the frontend code.

**Transition steps:**

1. **Develop** frontends against the mock server — the mock serves as the initial adapter
2. **Evaluate** vendors against the behavioral contract
3. **Select** vendor and configure their engine to match the contract
4. **Build** a vendor-specific adapter that exposes the same API surface
5. **Validate** — run the integration test suite to verify conformance
6. **Swap** — point frontend to production adapter
7. **Retire** mock server for that domain

The contracts double as a **vendor evaluation checklist**: can this system support these transitions? These effects? These rule conditions? These SLA behaviors? If a vendor can't satisfy the contracts, you know before you buy.

## What States Get From This Project

This project provides contracts and development tooling. States build their own production backends — in whatever language or framework they use — that satisfy those contracts.

| Artifact | Audience | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| OpenAPI specs | Developers | Define the REST API surface (schemas, endpoints, parameters) |
| State machine YAML | Developers | Define the RPC API surface (states, transitions, guards, effects, events, notifications, audit requirements) |
| Rules YAML | Developers | Define condition-based decisions: routing, assignment, priority, alerts |
| Metrics YAML | Developers | Define what to measure: metric names, labels, source linkage, targets |
| Field metadata YAML | Developers | Define field-level annotations, permissions, and labels served by the backend |
| Validation script | Developers | Verify contract artifacts are internally consistent (state machine states match OpenAPI enums, effect targets reference real schemas, event payloads resolve, audit requirements satisfied) — runs in CI |
| Mock server | Developers | Self-contained adapter with in-memory database for frontend development and integration testing |
| Integration test suite | Developers | Auto-generated from contracts (transition tests, guard tests, effect verification, event emission checks). Tests verify outcomes, not implementation — it doesn't matter whether the adapter or vendor executed an effect, as long as the expected side effects occurred |
| Decision tables | Business analysts + developers | Spreadsheets defining conditions and actions for routing, assignment, priority — conversion scripts generate the rules YAML |
| State transition tables | Business analysts + developers | Spreadsheets defining transitions, guards, and effects across related tables — conversion scripts generate the state machine YAML |
| Field metadata tables | Developers + business analysts | Spreadsheets defining field annotations, permissions, and labels — conversion scripts generate the field metadata YAML |
| State machine visualizations | Business analysts | Auto-generated diagrams from the state machine YAML showing states, transitions, and actors |
| ORCA data explorer | All | Interactive tool for exploring API contracts — schemas, endpoints, relationships, and domain structure |

Adding a new domain to the mock server is declarative — define artifacts, not code. Add an OpenAPI spec and the mock auto-generates CRUD endpoints; add a state machine YAML and it auto-generates RPC API endpoints with transition enforcement, effects, and rule evaluation. Add field metadata YAML and the mock serves it via a metadata API endpoint.

States don't have to use the base contracts as-is. An overlay system lets states customize any contract artifact — OpenAPI specs, state machine YAML, rules, metrics, field metadata — without forking the base files. Overlays use JSONPath targeting to add, modify, or remove specific elements (e.g., add a state-specific rule, adjust a metric target, modify a transition's guard, add fields to a form section). The base contracts plus overlays produce a merged result that the validation script and integration tests run against, so customizations are still verified for consistency.

**How a state uses this:**

1. Install the contracts as a dependency
2. Apply overlays to customize contracts for state-specific needs
3. Develop frontends against the mock server
4. Build a production backend (the adapter) that exposes the same API surface, translating to their vendor systems
5. Run the integration test suite against the production backend to verify conformance
6. Swap the frontend from mock server to production backend

## Risks and Mitigations

### Architecture risks

| Risk | Mitigation | Residual risk |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| **Mock-to-production gap** — The mock server interprets contracts directly. Production adapters translate to vendor systems. Edge cases, concurrency, timing, and error handling may behave differently. | Complex domains are prototyped and proven in this repo before states adopt, exercising the mock server's behavioral engine against real domain complexity. The integration test suite runs against both mock and production adapters, verifying the same outcomes. Tests are auto-generated from contracts, so coverage tracks the contract surface. | Behaviors that are hard to specify declaratively — race conditions, concurrent claims, SLA clock precision — may pass mock tests but fail in production under load. Manual test cases are needed for these. |
| **Vendor contract fidelity** — Not every vendor can natively satisfy every contract requirement. Gaps push behavior into the adapter, increasing its complexity. | The contracts double as a vendor evaluation checklist (see [Contracts as requirements](#contracts-as-requirements)). Gaps are identified before vendor selection, not after. The hybrid model explicitly supports splitting work between vendor and adapter. | The "simple backend" path means the adapter becomes a mini workflow engine. States choosing this path take on significant implementation effort that the contracts specify but don't automate. |
| **Contract-code drift** — Over time, production adapters may accumulate behavior not reflected in the contracts. The contracts stop being the source of truth. | The integration test suite is the enforcement mechanism — it's generated from contracts, so passing tests means the adapter conforms. Running tests in CI on every deploy keeps drift visible. | Drift in areas not covered by generated tests (logging, performance characteristics, vendor-specific features) won't be caught. Discipline is needed to add manual test cases for these. |
| **State machine expressiveness** — Statechart semantics cover common lifecycle patterns, but some workflows may need constructs that don't fit cleanly (parallel states, hierarchical states, long-running sagas). | The state machine schema is extensible — domains add top-level fields as requirements emerge (e.g., `onCreate`, `onTimeout`). Statechart semantics already support hierarchy and parallelism if needed. | If a workflow fundamentally doesn't fit a state machine model (e.g., a free-form collaborative process), the contract-driven approach adds friction rather than value. These domains may be better served by a simpler REST API with application-level orchestration. |
| **Expression language limitations** — JSON Logic (or the chosen format) may prove insufficient for complex conditions in rules or form visibility. | The architecture is format-agnostic at the authoring layer — states can author in any expression language and have conversion scripts translate to the canonical format. Switching the canonical format is a tooling change, not a contract restructure. | Migration cost scales with the number of existing rules and form conditions. Early adoption of a more expressive language (CEL, FEEL) reduces this risk but increases the learning curve. |

### Implementation risks

| Risk | Mitigation | Residual risk |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| **Authoring pipeline reliability** — Tables-to-YAML conversion scripts are a critical path. If conversion is lossy or buggy, the generated YAML won't match what was authored. | The conversion scripts are tested against real domains prototyped in this repo, not just documented as a pattern. The validation script runs on every generated YAML, catching structural inconsistencies (missing states, dangling references, invalid transitions). Round-trip tests can verify that table → YAML → rendered output preserves intent. | Semantic errors — a condition that's logically wrong but structurally valid — won't be caught by validation. Review of the generated YAML is still needed for correctness, the same way generated code needs review. |
| **Adoption curve** — Business analysts author tables, developers understand artifact connections, frontend developers consume field metadata. Each audience has a learning curve. | States adopt proven, working domains — not abstract patterns. The authoring experience is table-based, not YAML-based — nobody edits YAML directly. Steel thread prototypes prove each artifact type end-to-end, and the base contracts serve as working examples that states customize rather than build from scratch. | States customizing existing domains face a much lower learning curve than building new ones. Adding an entirely new domain that doesn't exist in the base contracts requires deeper architectural understanding. |
| **Field metadata scope creep** — Field metadata could grow to encode form rendering logic, blurring the line between backend-served metadata and frontend application code. | The format is deliberately constrained — annotations, permissions, and labels. Layout, sections, component mapping, and navigation are frontend concerns handled by the [harness repo](https://github.com/codeforamerica/safety-net-harness), not contract concerns. | Pressure to add rendering concerns to field metadata is ongoing. Each addition needs to be evaluated against whether it belongs in the data model (metadata) or the presentation layer (harness). |
| **Overlay brittleness for behavioral artifacts** — Overlays targeting states, transitions, or rules are more fragile than schema overlays. Renaming a state or transition has cascading effects across multiple artifacts (state machine, rules, metrics, field metadata). | The validation script checks cross-artifact references — if an overlay renames a state, validation fails if metrics or rules still reference the old name. The resolve CLI warns on stale overlay targets. | States customizing behavioral contracts need deeper understanding of artifact connections than states only customizing schemas. The overlay authoring guide needs to cover these dependencies explicitly. |

### Highest implementation risk

The **mock server's behavioral engine** carries the most implementation risk. It must correctly interpret state machines (transitions, guards, effects, SLA clocks), evaluate rules (routing, assignment, priority), and orchestrate side effects (record creation, notifications, event emission) — all from declarative YAML. This is effectively building a lightweight workflow engine. Complex domains are prototyped in this repo specifically to prove this engine against real requirements before states adopt. If the engine has flaws, they surface during prototyping — not when a state connects a production adapter. The residual risk shifts from "will this work?" to "does a state's customization break something that worked in the base?" — which the validation script and integration tests are designed to catch.
