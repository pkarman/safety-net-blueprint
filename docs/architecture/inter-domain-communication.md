# Inter-Domain Communication

The Safety Net Blueprint uses a pub/sub, event-driven model for cross-domain coordination. Domains are loosely coupled — each domain publishes events when its state changes; other domains subscribe and react independently. No domain needs to know who is consuming its events, and adding a new consumer requires no change to the producer.

---

## Event Model

### CloudEvents envelope

All blueprint events use the [CloudEvents 1.0](https://cloudevents.io/) envelope. Key attributes:

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `id` | Unique event identifier |
| `type` | Event type — `org.codeforamerica.safety-net-blueprint.{domain}.{entity}.{verb}` |
| `source` | Domain that produced the event — `/intake`, `/workflow`, etc. |
| `subject` | Entity ID the event pertains to |
| `time` | When the event occurred |
| `data` | Event payload (domain-specific) |
| `traceparent` *(optional)* | W3C Trace Context header propagated from the triggering request or event; carries a trace ID (stable across the full causal chain) and parent ID (immediate parent) |

State partners may overlay the `type` prefix to match their own namespace.

### Event contracts

Event contracts for each domain live in two artifacts:

- **OpenAPI spec** (`x-events` section) — declares each event's CloudEvents type name and payload schema reference
- **State machine** — declares which hooks emit which events. Three hooks are available: `onCreate` (object creation), `onUpdate` (field changes outside a transition), and `transitions` (state changes and non-state-changing actor actions)

AsyncAPI specs are generated from these two sources. State partners do not author AsyncAPI directly — they overlay the source artifacts and regenerate.

## `/events` Endpoint

The blueprint exposes a centralized `/events` endpoint as a queryable event log. It serves two purposes:

1. **Audit and history** — brokers have retention limits and aren't designed for time-range queries. The `/events` endpoint provides a permanent, queryable record regardless of how events are delivered in real time.
2. **Polling-based delivery** — states not yet running a message broker poll `/events` in place of broker subscriptions.

### Cross-domain correlation

Every event carries the entity ID as the CloudEvents `subject`. Because every domain uses the same subject for the same entity, a single query returns a complete cross-domain timeline:

```
GET /events?subject=00000004-0000-4000-8000-000000000001
```

Filtering by `type` or `source` narrows results to a specific domain or event kind.

For causal chain tracing, the `traceparent` attribute propagates the W3C Trace Context from the triggering request or event. The trace ID it carries is stable across the entire chain — every downstream event shares the same trace ID, so the full causal chain is recoverable in a single query filtered by trace ID.

## URL Structure

Every domain API uses a domain-prefixed base path declared in the `servers` entry of its OpenAPI spec:

| Domain | Base path |
|--------|-----------|
| Intake | `/intake` |
| Workflow | `/workflow` |
| Platform (events, search) | `/platform` |

Domain identity is explicit in every URL — in logs, traces, gateway routing rules, and documentation. Path-based routing is the standard pattern for API gateways.

Prefixes are declared in the `servers` entry of each OpenAPI spec and can be overlaid by state partners. A state that prefers `/shared` over `/platform`, or `/benefits/intake` over `/intake`, changes the `servers` entry and regenerates — no paths within the spec change.

---

## Event Versioning

Pub/sub creates semantic coupling — payload shape is a contract. New fields may be added to an event without versioning. Breaking changes (removed or renamed fields) require a new version.

The `.v2` suffix convention on the event type is common (used by Confluent, AWS EventBridge, and others) and keeps the version visible in routing rules and logs:

```
org.codeforamerica.safety-net-blueprint.intake.application.submitted
org.codeforamerica.safety-net-blueprint.intake.application.submitted.v2
```

Both types are published in parallel until all consumers have migrated. The old type is then retired.

CloudEvents also includes an optional `dataschema` attribute for linking to a schema definition (e.g., a schema registry URL). This keeps type names stable across versions and is more aligned with the CloudEvents design intent, but requires a schema registry or stable schema URLs to be useful.

## Implementation Path

The target architecture is pub/sub with CloudEvents messages. Most implementations won't start there.

**Step 1 — REST polling on `/events`:** Producers write events to the `/events` store directly. Consumers poll the endpoint on a schedule, tracking position with a cursor. When a broker is in place, producers publish to broker topics and polling is replaced by subscriptions; the `/events` endpoint remains for audit queries.

**Step 2 — Pub/sub:** Producers publish to broker topics; consumers subscribe and receive events in real time. AWS EventBridge, SNS/SQS, Azure Service Bus, and Google Cloud Pub/Sub all support CloudEvents natively. Migration from Step 1 requires no event contract changes — only the delivery mechanism changes.

## PII in event payloads

Event payloads may contain PII, FTI (Federal Tax Information), or PHI (Protected Health Information). How states safeguard this data in their event infrastructure is an implementation concern, not a blueprint contract concern — the blueprint does not prescribe an encryption mechanism, access control policy, or key management approach.

The blueprint's responsibility is to mark which fields are sensitive so that adapters know what requires protection. Schema fields carrying regulated data are annotated with `x-data-classification` (see [api-patterns.yaml](../../packages/contracts/patterns/api-patterns.yaml)). Classifications: `pii`, `fti`, `phi`.

States are responsible for:
- Applying appropriate safeguards to classified fields in event payloads (encryption, access control, log masking)
- Meeting regulatory requirements for the classifications present in their deployment (IRS Pub. 1075 for `fti`, HIPAA for `phi`)
- Ensuring their event store and broker infrastructure meets those requirements
