# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains architecture documentation for the Safety Net Benefits API.

> **Status: Work in progress** — The system is being designed incrementally, domain by domain.

## How this documentation is organized

| Document | What it covers |
|----------|---------------|
| [Domain Design](domain-design.md) | Domain organization, entities, data flow, and domain status |
| [Contract-Driven Architecture](contract-driven-architecture.md) | Contract artifacts for backend and frontend portability. Frontend harness packages are in a [separate repo](https://github.com/codeforamerica/safety-net-harness). |
| [API Architecture](api-architecture.md) | API organization, operational concerns, quality attributes |
| [Design Rationale](design-rationale.md) | Key decisions with rationale and alternatives |
| [Roadmap](roadmap.md) | Implementation phases, prototypes, future considerations |

## Domain and cross-cutting docs
