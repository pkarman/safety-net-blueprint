## What It Does

An Express-based mock API server that auto-discovers OpenAPI specs, creates SQLite databases, and seeds them from example files. Use it for frontend development without a production backend.

- Auto-discovers all `*-openapi.yaml` specs
- Creates per-spec SQLite databases with full CRUD support
- Seeds databases from `*.yaml` seed files in `packages/mock-server/seed/`
- Supports search, pagination, and filtering
- Includes Swagger UI for interactive API exploration
