## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- Zod datetime validation now accepts UTC offset format (`+00:00`) in addition to `Z` suffix. OpenAPI's `format: date-time` references RFC 3339 which allows both, but the generated Zod schemas previously rejected the offset form. This caused runtime validation failures with backends that serialize datetimes with `+00:00` (e.g., Django, Python's `.isoformat()`).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- Search helpers with semantic file organization
- Utilities path for packaging

### Fixed

- Windows glob expansion in test scripts (replaced shell globs with directory paths)
- Postman generator sort order and path param extraction fixes

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-15

### Added

- TypeScript client generation via `@hey-api/openapi-ts` with Zod 4.x schemas
- JSON Schema conversion from OpenAPI specs
- Postman collection generation
- State-specific package builder (`build-state-package.js`) producing `@codeforamerica/safety-net-openapi-{state}` packages
- npm workspace packaging and publishing infrastructure
